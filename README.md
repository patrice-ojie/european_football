# European Football Game Analysis

The database for this project was found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dimarudov/data-analysis-using-sql/input

I wrote queries to find out information on the following:
Highest Goals at a Home Game
Highest Goals at an Away Game
Goal Difference
Average Goals per Match in each League
Average Player Rating

The queries were written in SQLiteStudio.
