# European Football Game Analysis

## Description

In this project, I wrote queries to find out information on the following:
* Highest Goals at a Home Game
* Highest Goals at an Away Game
* Goal Difference
* Average Goals per Match in each League
* Average Player Rating

A summary of which can be found in the Report file.

## Installation

In order for the code to work as it is, you will need to run it in a software that can take SQL directly. I chose to use SQLiteStudio which can be downloaded here: https://sqlitestudio.pl/. You can also run it in Python if you are familiar with using SQL in Python.

## Usage
You will need a copy of the database in order to see my results and make queries of your own. The database for this project was found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/dimarudov/data-analysis-using-sql/input
